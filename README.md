# verify-medium-integrity

This script can be used to detect if an installation medium of RPM-based Linux distribution (OpenMandriva, openSUSE, Fedora, etc.) is corrupt. It does so by comparing files on the disk to metadata in RPM database. See `VERIFY OPTIONS` section of `man 8 rpm` for the detailed explanation of the output.
